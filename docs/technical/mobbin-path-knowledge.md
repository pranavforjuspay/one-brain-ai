# Mobbin Search Path Knowledge

## Overview
This document captures the robust search paths discovered for Mobbin.com, ensuring predictable and reliable automation workflows.

## Successful Path: Intelligent Suggestion Evaluation

### Path Description
**Direct Search with App Suggestion Selection**
- Navigate to iOS section → Click "Search on iOS..." → Type keyword → Evaluate suggestions → Click specific app

### Real Implementation (Tested Successfully)
1. **Navigate to iOS section** ✅ (Already completed)
2. **Click "Search on iOS..." button** ✅ 
   - Opens modal with search input
3. **Type initial keyword** ✅ 
   - Used "banking" 
   - Triggers real-time suggestions
4. **Evaluate suggestions against backend analysis** ✅
   - Found exact matches: Chase UK, Revolut, Monzo
   - These matched our backend analysis comparables
5. **Click specific app suggestion** ✅
   - Selected "Chase UK" 
   - Successfully navigated to Chase UK app screens

### Backend Analysis Integration
- **Real backend analysis** provided: iOS platform (priority 0.82), fintech category
- **Comparables identified**: Chase Mobile, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Revolut, Monzo
- **Keywords**: ["login", "banking", "biometric", "authentication", "mobile"]

### Suggestion Types Available
1. **App-specific suggestions** (preferred when available)
   - Chase UK, Revolut, Monzo, N26, Chime, etc.
   - More targeted results for specific banking patterns
2. **General search** (fallback)
   - "Press Enter to search" with typed keywords
   - Broader results across multiple apps
3. **Text in screenshot search**
   - Search for specific text within app screenshots

### Decision Logic
```
IF (backend analysis has comparables) AND (suggestions contain matching apps)
  THEN click specific app suggestion
ELSE 
  THEN proceed with general keyword search
```

### Selectors Documented
- **Search button**: `text=Search on iOS...`
- **Modal input**: `input[type="text"]`
- **App suggestions**: `text={AppName}` (e.g., `text=Chase UK`)
- **Results**: `.design-card, .result-item, .app-screens`

## Alternative Paths (Not Yet Tested)

### Finance Category Path
- **Trigger**: Click "Finance" in left sidebar
- **Unknown**: What interface appears after category selection?
- **Risk**: May not have search functionality on category pages

### Platform Switch Path
- **Trigger**: Switch between iOS/Web/Android
- **Use case**: Cross-platform analysis
- **Status**: Not yet explored

## Configuration Updates Made

### New Workflow: `intelligentSuggestionSearch`
```typescript
intelligentSuggestionSearch: [
  { action: 'click', selector: 'text=Search on iOS...', description: 'Open search modal' },
  { action: 'fill', selector: 'input[type="text"]', value: '{{initialKeyword}}' },
  { action: 'waitFor', selector: 'text={{appSuggestion}}', timeout: 3000 },
  { action: 'click', selector: 'text={{appSuggestion}}', description: 'Click best matching suggestion' }
]
```

### Enhanced iOS Search Workflow
- Updated to use modal-based search
- Added suggestion evaluation steps
- Documented app-specific vs general search paths

## Success Metrics
- ✅ **Real backend analysis integration**: Used actual strategy analysis endpoint
- ✅ **Predictable selectors**: No dynamic screenshot navigation needed
- ✅ **Intelligent path selection**: Chose app-specific over general search
- ✅ **Successful navigation**: Reached Chase UK app screens with banking patterns

## Next Steps
1. **Extract results** from Chase UK app screens
2. **Filter for authentication patterns** (login, biometric, Face ID, Touch ID)
3. **Test alternative paths** (Finance category, other app suggestions)
4. **Document additional robust paths** as they're discovered

## Key Learnings
1. **Suggestion evaluation is crucial**: Don't blindly search - evaluate what Mobbin suggests
2. **App-specific paths are superior**: More targeted than general keyword searches
3. **Backend analysis integration works**: Real strategy analysis provides valuable guidance
4. **Modal-based search is reliable**: Consistent interface across different entry points
